SDG – GOOD HEALTH AND WELL BEING 

Problem –  Because of the undergoing current crisis of Sri Lanka many product that used to be imported to the country have ceased. One of the main
industries affected has been the “Health Sector.” Essential medicines and medical equipment are no longer being imported into the country.
This has badly affected for the good health and well-being of the Sri Lankan people in a highly detrimental manner

Solution- Therefore, the aim of our web application is to identify and to help supply the vital and essential medicines and medical equipment are secure
from hospitals and places where they are available. Our web application is designed to identify and connect these organizations. So, people in
other parts of the country and other parts of the world can donate and supply these essential medicines and medical equipment through our
web application to the places and hospital where they are lacking. Likewise, we may give to a medical project using our online application,
and users can view medical activities arranged by other parties
